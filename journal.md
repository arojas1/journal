## Week One

### First hr:
- Created shortcut of my OneDrive Software folder in Desktop (using GUI not Terminal).
- Moved shortcut to home.
- Tried moving Projects directory into shortcut. Could not because it is just a link not a directory.
- Tested if I can use echo to add another line to the cheat sheet we created in class. Found out that it would rewrite the file.
- Added all the commands to the cheat sheet file and used the cat command to see it in the terminal.
	
### Second and third hr:
- Continuied with command line practice.
    - cat nypl_items.csv | uniq > nypl_no_dupes.csv.
- Completed all of the challenges.
- When doing challenge 5, the cd command in the .sh file was not actually putting me in the directory I wanted to be in. After some time googling, I found the post that explained that I had to put the command in like "$ . goto-projects.sh". This is when it actually put me into the directory I wanted to be in.
- Created an alias "startclass" to run goto-projects.sh.
- Adjusted what goto-projects.sh does so that it can set up items at the beginning of class (puts me into projects folder, opens cheatsheet, prints ready).
	
### Fourth hr:
- Reviewed content under Week 1 optional resources.

### Fifth hr:
- Command practice using grep and thinking of how to use this in my other class.
